SIC LIFE LOGO SETUP

To see your logo on the login and register pages:

1. Save your SIC Life logo as: sic-life-logo.png
2. Place it in this folder: sic-life-app/client/public/images/
3. The logo should be a PNG image with transparent background
4. Recommended size: 200x200px or larger

Your logo will then appear on:
- Left side of login page (large size)
- Left side of register page (large size)  
- Form headers (smaller size)

Current status: Logo image missing - showing fallback gear icon
Next step: Add your sic-life-logo.png file here
